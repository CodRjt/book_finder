This is a library cataloge or book finder web app , created using streamlit.

I have used the "all-MiniLM-L6-v2:  language model to implement the semantic search and streamlit to create the webpage.

The default dataset is a small csv dataset with 100 records from goodbooks-10k-extended https://github.com/malcolmosh/goodbooks-10k-extended.
